# CarND-PID-Control-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
Term 2, Project 4: PID Control Project

In this project we revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, we implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

The simulator provides the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.


## Reflection

### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

| Component        | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| P (Proportional) | Steering changes are made in proportion to the error value. Where the error and steering angle are large, the car overshoots the center line repeatedly and oscillation occurs.  |
| I (Integral)     | Mitigates systemic bias which prevents the car from reaching the center line. |
| D (Derivative    | Dampens oscillation by weighting the rate of change of the error. |

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

I tuned the parameters manually, beginning with a workable P value and modifying D until I could successfully
traverse a lap of the track. In this example, I did not require a non-zero value for I.

pid.Init(-0.25, 0, -0.75);

To achieve faster lap times, I would use a gradient descent/"Twiddle" algorithm to further tune the parameters
and introduce a separate variable controller for throttle values based on turn, error and steering.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!
